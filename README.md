# Diary-Java

The goal of this project was to practice mocking with Java.

I used an interface for the Diary class (IDiary) that was later turned into an Inner Class inside the `SecretDiaryTest.java` file.

By doing this, I was able to mock the behaviour of `Diary` inside of the `SecretDiary` class.
